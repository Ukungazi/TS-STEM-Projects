        <h3>Chronological Description</h3>
        <p>This project started from a culmination of a few youtube videos. It slowly evolved into an actual project as I began to grasp the actual concept behind the scenes. I still remember the moment where I realized that it was possible to actually reproduce the nebulous results I saw when looking into electrolysis. A steady flame, an explosion, modding a nerf gun for faster darts. There lied various applications for one single process. The culmination of knowledge lead to a strange dichotomy within this project for me. I understood enough to know how the process worked individually, but yet I could never seem to know enough to fully understand how all of the processes worked together on the same principle to produce different results. So I tried it my hand at an Application of electrolysis. </p>

        <P>Then I immediately hit a roadblock, as a 10-year-old without access to any of the supplies required for what I was doing. So I needed investors (that was a metaphor for my parents which is a little weird, but ima roll with it). I had to explain the process and my plan of which I little to none even prepared so that didnâ€™t go well.</P>
