    <h2>Patriot's Day</h2>
    <p class="tab">In 7th grade, my middle school hosted an event called “Patriot's Day” where students wore colonial-style outfits, participated in teams in an open market, and participated in contests like tug of war, needle threading, and pie eating. I collaborated with some friends on making a booth for the open market. This event taught me a great deal about how to organize, compromise, and communicate with others as I ended up leading the group.</p>
    <p class="tab">In the beginning, we were not exactly sure what we were going to make, so we decided to all meet at Fox Build, a local maker space. There we started out in a meeting room to decide what to make, what to call our booth, and what type of store it would be. We started off with the name, and we quickly settled on “Bean Boys” since it was funny. However, we had trouble deciding what type of store to be. We were at a deadlock between being a toy store and a military surplus shop, with 2 team members on either side. I was not opposed to the title of military surplus, just to the possibility of ending up without any inventory or diversity. Through compromise, we settled on taking the title of military surplus, while stretching the definition to include other products that were more like toys. This meeting showed me how teams need proper communication to operate. Without that compromise, we would have wasted time, and likely run the risk of splitting the team since that was a legitimate option at the time.</p>
    <p class="tab">With our plans in place, we organized multiple later meetings so that we could begin making the items: starting with the canteens. By using the drill press on some waste wood and inserting cork stoppers into the hole the canteens were constructed quite quickly. The next focus was crafting the swords, and to make these we cut out their outline on a CNC Maslow using a file I designed myself. After that we wrapped their handles in some leather and secured them with tacks, being careful to make sure the tip of the tack did not stick out the other end. Last were the Jacob’s Ladders, I was the person tasked with assembling because of their complexity and unique material requirements.</p>
    <p class="tab">At the end of the day, this event where my friends and I jokingly made a stand is probably the best time I had on a team. To top this all off, we ended up being sold out at the end of the day despite being well stocked. This event taught me a lot about organizing, compromising, and communicating with members of a team. As a result, I have developed some leadership skills and have been able to fill that role in some later group assignments.</p>
