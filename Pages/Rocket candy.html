      <h2>Rocket Candy</h2>
      <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
      
      <p>This was a project that I will never really feel proud of. I spent numerous hours learning everything that I needed to know in order to make Rocket Candy which I’ll be referring to as R-Candy for these following paragraphs. I had even succeeded in the end. I took my experience from all my previous projects and used it effectively to succeed, but it felt hollow because I didn’t connect the dots by myself.</p> 

      <p>I learned about rocket candy from William Osman’s video that included it. Then literally just googled “rocket candy” to get a full guide from the channel TKOR made by Grant Thomson who is a great creator and it is horrible what happened to him. I just copied his recipes, and I don’t really know how to feel about that. If I was given the chance I would go back and try to improve those recipes, and maybe one day I will. For now though, I want the be honest and contribute this project’s success entirely to him.</p>

      <p>What makes this project different though, and why am I not proud of it like the electrolytic cell? Well, it wasn’t hard like the electrolytic cell, and I didn’t understand it the same, don’t get me wrong I understood R-candy well. Everything from the chemical equation for its combustion, to the suspension of Potassium nitrate in caramelized sugar, to the solubility of the two main ingredients in water, had a place in my head. The difference was that it was a mindless process. I simply learned those facts and used them to imitate other’s success, whereas with the electrolitic cell I understood the concept and the variables' effect on the outcome.</p>
      
      <p>I am proud of the electrolytic cell project because I didn’t have a step-by-step guide to making an electrolytic cell. I made my first cell and second cell before multiple videos were released explaining the whole concept. I feel as if I was there before it was understood. I know that I wasn’t, and I know that people already knew exactly how to make these things, but I didn’t have access to those people or their knowledge. I had to figure out that I couldn’t use salt as an electrolyte for myself, and every other small but important intricacy was an adverse and rewarding challenge.</p>
