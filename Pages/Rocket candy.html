        <h2>Rocket Candy</h2>
        <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>

        <p>This was a project that I will never really feel proud of. I spent numerous hours learning everything that I
          needed to know in order to make Rocket Candy which I’ll be referring to as R-Candy for these following
          paragraphs. I had even succeeded in the end. I took my experience from all my previous projects and used it
          effectively to succeed, but it felt hollow because I didn’t connect the dots by myself.</p>

        <p>I learned about rocket candy from William Osman’s video that included it. Then literally just googled “rocket
          candy” to get a full guide from the channel TKOR made by Grant Thomson who is a great creator and it is
          horrible what happened to him. I just copied his recipes, and I don’t really know how to feel about that. If I
          was given the chance I would go back and try to improve those recipes, and maybe one day I will. For now
          though, I want the be honest and contribute this project’s success entirely to him.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>What makes this project different though, and why am I not proud of it like the electrolytic cell? Well, it
            wasn’t hard like the electrolytic cell, and I didn’t understand it the same, don’t get me wrong I understood
            R-candy well. Everything from the chemical equation for its combustion, to the suspension of Potassium
            nitrate in caramelized sugar, to the solubility of the two main ingredients in water, had a place in my
            head. The difference was that it was a mindless process. I simply learned those facts and used them to
            imitate other’s success, whereas with the electrolitic cell I understood the concept and the variables'
            effect on the outcome.</p>

          <p>I am proud of the electrolytic cell project because I didn’t have a step-by-step guide to making an
            electrolytic cell. I made my first cell and second cell before multiple videos were released explaining the
            whole concept. I feel as if I was there before it was understood. I know that I wasn’t, and I know that
            people already knew exactly how to make these things, but I didn’t have access to those people or their
            knowledge. I had to figure out that I couldn’t use salt as an electrolyte for myself, and every other small
            but important intricacy was an adverse and rewarding challenge.</p>

          <P>I am not going to elaborate on the first batch of this fuel I made, because it really isn't notable since I
            essentaly just mixed Potassium Nitrate and sugar together and caramelized the sugar.</P>

          <h3 id="Rust">Making Rust</h3>
          <br>
          <p>This was by far my favorite part of the whole project because this optional step to make rust taught me a
            bit about the process we call rust, and about oxygen as an element. I wanted to get rust as an ingredient in
            the recipe of the rocket fuel and rust powder was expensive and only really sold in bulk, so I went about
            finding my own method. I started with Wikipedia and began looking for ways to oxidize iron. Hydrogen
            peroxide was immediately interesting to me since it is commonly used as an oxidizing agent. Along with salt
            because of my experience with electrolytic cells I knew that an electrolyte would help the electrons move
            more easily. A solution of these two ingredients together did rust metal, but the rust stuck to the metal
            despite being so quickly formed.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I knew that vinegar breaks up rust and I wanted to try a solution using that to separate the rust from the
            metal. I also tried a solution using alcohol thinking that by making it evaporate recently after forming the
            rust it would become more separated from the metal. Although I had neglected using a physical method when I
            realized this I used a wire brush and easily was able to get the rust off a piece of metal.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I settled on a solution with store-bought hydrogen peroxide taking up about 90% - 100% of the liquid
            solution since the hydrogen peroxide itself was diluted enough to be safe and it was the main active
            ingredient. Salt was added liberally even though I probably didn’t need a lot as I began to realize in the
            last few batches. Vinegar occasionally took up 10% of the remaining liquid and I sorta mixed around the
            ratios that I had but I never really found a concrete difference. I then applied this solution to a piece of
            steel I bought and degreased instead of the small sample pieces I was using for testing. I applied the
            solution then put it outside to evaporate. Once evaporated I would take a wire brush and clean off the rust
            from the metal, and put it into a container. I would finally put the container by a dehumidifier, or outside
            behind some wind block to dry out the powder as much as I could.</p>

          <h3 id="Copper_Cloride">Making Copper Cloride</h3>
          <p>Copper Chloride was a neat side project where I was really just looking to see what I could add to the
            R-Candy. I went looking for those salts that make fire change color and then went like “yo but like what if
            I made it?” So I went about doing that and found that copper chloride could be made by just putting copper
            in hydrochloric acid and boiling off the solution afterward. So I did that and it was fun. I’ll have two
            videos down below. One which shows the guy and method I used to make Copper Chloride and one of me proving
            that It was copper Chloride with a flame test.</p>
          <h3 id="Potassium_Clorate">Attempt to make Potassium Clorate</h3>
          <p>So this was the other salt that I wanted to make so that I could color the flame of the fuel. This didn't
            really work probably because I couldn't find proper filter paper, and because I added too much salt, and a
            myriad of other issues with trying to separate 2 quite similar salts. I did some research to find that the
            salt is sold in a mix with regular table salt and sold as a diet salt lower potassium alternative. After all
            that advanced research on where to find it I boneheadedly tried some random guy on the internet with a “it
            worked before” mentality. That failed hard since it relied on heating the salt to make a super solution,
            then cooling it so only the Potassium chloride came out of solution, and that was smart but my heating
            element was about as reliable as a goldfish after the third day and half as strong. (WIP)</p>
