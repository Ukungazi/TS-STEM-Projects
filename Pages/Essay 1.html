    <h2>Why I want to attend IMSA</h2>
    <p class="tab">I want to attend IMSA because it provides an academic challenge and unique opportunities in an environment of excellence. These opportunities consist of immersive language classes, course selection, cool internships, and STEM-invested peers. I also see IMSA as a potentially crucial stepping stone to help me further The Great Conversation.</p>
    <p class="tab">I was excited to learn that IMSA hosted full immersion language classes because I believe that full immersion language classes are the best way to learn a language. I have recently spent time in Costa Rica, and believe that when forced to speak without direct ties to English, fluency is built faster. I have also spent a sizeable amount of time on the app Duolingo learning languages like Spanish, German, and Latin.</p>
    <p class="tab">Furthermore, the courses are a big factor in my decision to make this application. I am currently in Junior level math as a Freshman. If I were to continue at Geneva Community High School, I would probably end up without a math class for my senior year. I know that IMSA has a wide variety of math classes, and as someone who enjoys math, I would prefer continuing with learning the subject rather than stagnating at my current school. </p>
    <p class="tab">Moreover, the opportunity to devote an entire day a week to an internship at a place like Fermilab or Argon Laboratory is something that especially intrigues me. It is an opportunity that is simply not available to me at Geneva Community Highschool. </p>
    <p class="tab">Equally important, is being challenged and doing so in an environment of people who also value STEM topics. In contrast, I do not feel challenged at my current school, and the vast majority of my friends are not invested in math or science.</p>
    <p class="tab">On a less tangible note, I have recently been inspired by The Great Conversation, from the Great Books collection. I found the book in the series that was collecting dust in the basement. It is quite refreshing to read of agreements and civilized debate on some of the great books of history, especially in a time where there is so much separation and argument politically. Therefore, I want to be able to contribute to The Great Conversation, and I believe that IMSA can help me achieve that.</p>
    <p class="tab">In closing, the superior opportunity for excellence and challenge of courses that IMSA offers as a school is the ultimate motivator for why I chose to apply. This is also why I chose to push myself to be more than the bare minimum for this application such as learning HTML, Java, and TI-84 Basic while also taking classes like Geometry, Algebra 2, and Chemistry. Believing that those same motivators will continue to lead me far into my future, I hope to provide something of use to the greater scientific community and provide another voice so as to speak and further the “Great Conversation”.</p>
