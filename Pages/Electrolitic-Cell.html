      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>This project started from a culmination of a few youtube videos. It slowly evolved into an actual project as I began to grasp the actual concept behind the scenes. I still remember the moment where I realized that it was possible to actually reproduce the nebulous results I saw when looking into electrolysis. A steady flame, an explosion, modding a nerf gun for faster darts. There lied various applications for one single process. The culmination of knowledge lead to a strange dichotomy within this project for me. I understood enough to know how the process worked individually, but yet I could never seem to know enough to fully understand how all of the processes worked together on the same principle to produce different results. So I tried it my hand at an Application of electrolysis.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Then I immediately hit a roadblock, as a 10-year-old without access to any of the supplies required for what I was doing. So I needed my parents to drive me somewhere to get things like lantern batteries and copper. This meant that I had to explain the process and my plan of which I little to none even prepared so that didn’t go well. Although after a good amount of <b>highly advanced pencil-based illustrations™</b> I had a design, and a plan.</p>
        <br>
      <p>After some quick trips for supplies, I had what I needed to assemble the rough design which included a power supply, anode, cathode, main solution jar, and blowback chamber (not related to firearms, but really just a jar where the gas was forced to bubble up. Which prevents the Browns gas formed from exploding into the chamber where it is formed). This is a safety procedure that I credit Peter Stripol for including in his video. This actually saved me in the second version of the project where without the tiny plastic chamber I would have shattered a much larger jar and spilled lots of basic (13 pH) lye super solution.</p>
        <br>
      <p>After my first design was assembled and I had to correct my dad on how to set up the electrolysis circuit we had the first version. I connected the batteries up in series, then hooked up the power to the cathode and anode. They both started bubbling as expected. The blowback chamber was working as expected. Then when it came to light the gas I had attached a needle to the end of the hose, so that the gas would be forced through and become a form of flame. I could never get he as to light, aside from a few sparks that were probably from the lighter itself.</p>
        <br>
      <p>When the day was done, I had not succeeded in accomplishing my goal of making a small flame with the gas. Although I was disgruntled I continued on with a level head. I had to learn why I had failed, and improve upon the design in a logical and safe manner. So I contrasted and compared the aspects of where my project failed with where others had succeeded. I found my first blunder: I used salt as an electrolyte since I thought It was unaffected by electrolysis. I think that I was wrong, and instead of forming HHO, I was actually forming a gas that contained Chlorine and other contaminants as a result of using salt (NaCl) as an electrolyte instead of lye (NaOH). This makes sense since lye contains a hydroxide group that if broken down would not really affect the gas aside from maybe adding nitrogen which is irrelevant anyway. My second blunder is having a jar that needed to be screwed on which caused leaks of gas. I just fixed this by getting a mason jar for the next version.</p>
