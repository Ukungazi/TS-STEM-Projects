      <h2>About the project:</h2>
      <p>It was the summer, and over the previous school year, I had learned how to program in Ti-84 basic. I was pretty confident in that skill, since it's a simple language and designed for math. Over that school year though I was learning Geometry; Sin, Cos, Tan, and a lot of equations that model things like area and surface area of certain types of shapes. This meant that there was a lot of graded busy work that was just meant to make sure you had memorized the equations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Since I wanted to spend the least amount of time doing mind-numbingly boring work I devised a solution. I would take the first three to four problems and slowly and meticulously solve them. This served to accomplish two things: to understand the essence of the equation and how it works, and to get a correct set of test problems and solutions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I would then whip up a quick program in the same style as I did in the video. I would take the necessary inputs via “prompt” maybe have a menu to select variations or restructured versions of the equations via “if, then, and else”. Once I had a working program I would finish the homework at a considerably faster pace. On most occasions, I would finish earlier than I would If I had just done the problems regularly.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The other side to the project was wanting to brush up on my narrating and editing skills. So I downloaded Debut Video Capture Software and Hitfilm Express and since I am using a free version of them I will link their website In the links section below.</p>
