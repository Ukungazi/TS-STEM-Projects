      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <h5>On Jul 20, 2021</h5>
      <br>
      <p>Boredom is something that frequently plagues me. On this occasion I was particularly bored and, happened upon an old video by Mark Rober. It had a whole ton of ideas for science projects, but one stood out to me. It used a formula for finding the speed of light that seemed way too simplistic to me at the time. So I looked into it further and found out that it was using the normal equation for speed speed=distance/time just in a weird way.</p>

      <p>The equation was S=F*W*2.  S being the speed of light, F being the frequency of the light, and W being the recorded wavelength. F is filled in by Hz or hertz, but what exactly is hertz? Well, hertz is cycles per second or c/1.</p> 
        
      <p>Then what is the whole W*2 thing mean? Well W is the recorded wavelength for this procedure of recording a heat map in a microwave, and we end up with a half wavelength and by multiplying by two you get a full wavelength</p>
        
      <p>Although there is still one more problem: In the classic speed equation, we divide the distance by the time to get our speed in the light speed equation we only multiply. The reason for this is within what frequency represents. The frequency for most microwaves is 2450 Mhz or 2.45*10^9 hz what all that means is that the light wave oscillates 2.45*10^9 every second, in big number form 2,450,000,000 times in a second. For scale, in a blink of an eye, the light oscillates 245,000,000 times, which if that was days, it would be five times longer than the lifespan of the oldest person to ever live. Alright, back on point though, if S=1/2450…/2W would be another correct form of the formula. This is because multiplying the numerator by the denominator to the power of -1 is the same as dividing. A picture will be down below explaining this because I’m not good at writing it out in text.</p>

      <h2>How it ended</h2>
      <h5>On Jul 20, 2021</h5>
      <br>
      <p>So now that I was interested in the concept, I had to try it for myself in real life. Let me start, by saying that this was a bad idea from the moment I couldn’t find the wavelength that my microwave output. This is because I took the average wavelength of microwaves and tried to continue the project. I loaded up a piece of cardboard with cheese and put it in the microwave. Then I pulled it out and began to measure. I repeatedly got distances of 2.5 inches and 3 in. Now is probably the time that I talk about the twist I put on this project since I kinda ripped it straight from Mark Rober. I had been looking at statistics and thought that I could apply the law of big numbers to the project, and get an accurate approximation of the speed of light if I repeatedly measured the melted spots.</p> 
      
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <img src="../Images/Microwave shenanigans/Cheese board.jpg" alt="Cheese Board"/>
          <img src="../Images/Microwave shenanigans/CheeseBoard2.jpg" alt="Cheese Board"/>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <img src="../Images/Microwave shenanigans/cheese.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>So I wasted a lot of cheese trying to find the speed of light. That was not a sentence I thought I would be writing today. Anyways a lot of cheese and sunk cost fallacy later I was close to the speed of light. Although I noticed something in my data. I was getting closer every time I put in another point of data. This was a little odd to me, since the chance of repeatedly getting closer to the speed of light without deviation is improbable, so I brought in my parents and asked them to measure the spots. They got the same 2.5 to 3 inches that I was in the beginning on different melted spots. This began to make sense once I went back to try and find an explanation for this.</p>
        
      <p>I think that because I understood the math behind it I favored the data that proved the equation or brought the calculation closer to the speed of light. I had confirmation bias and because my parents did not know, they gave honest measurements.</p>
        
      <p>I had wasted so much cheese on data that is garbage. So I had to turn the data into something. So I found something that the world doesn’t seem to know: the wavelength of my microwave. No, seriously I spent a lot of time on the internet, looking up the serial number, in forums, parts lists, and I cant find the label for the frequency since the microwave can't be taken out of it's location. I could not find a single lead on the wavelength of the old beaten-up microwave.</p>
      <div class="img-thumbnail"><img src="../Images/Microwave shenanigans/Looking for Frequency.jpg" alt="Looking for Frequency" style="width: 100%;"></div> 
      <p>So I flipped around some numbers and got to the conclusion that the microwave operated at around 4290 Mhz. Now for a tribute to all the fallen cheese squares:</p>
