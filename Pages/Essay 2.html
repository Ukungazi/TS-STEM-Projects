    <h2>A Significant Challenge I Have Faced</h2>
    <p class="tab">Algebra 1 was the hardest academic challenge I have faced so far. To put this course in perspective: I consider my experience with Geometry and Algebra 2 to be quite easy, but that is because of the skills I gained from Algebra 1. Algebra 1 was especially hard because I took the class without the prerequisite of Prealgebra, during the Covid-19 pandemic, and on a crunch schedule. However, I came to enjoy that challenge in that class more than in any other math class.</p>
    <p class="tab">When I started the class it was quite easy. In fact, the first few days were just introductory assignments with minimal work. At the time, I was aware of the extra challenge that my circumstances posed, but I still approached the class as if it was simply another math class. As the course progressed it gradually became more apparent that this approach was not going to work. It was only when I started missing deadlines that this realization set in. I never once considered stepping down though, and thus I had to face why I was falling behind.</p>
    <p class="tab">One of the major reasons was that I was behind was that I never managed my time. To solve that problem I started using a few things like schedules, and applying the math I had learned so far to make a plan on how to get back up to pace with a schedule that was supplied by my teacher at the start of the course. Although, this was all the groundwork for the most important part: actually doing the work. Jokes aside, this is the course that broke my long-held procrastination mentality.</p>
    <p class="tab">After I had initially caught up, I was able to slow down and relax a bit. The pace was still faster than any school year I had gone through, but I began to enjoy the challenge. As someone who previously despised math, this was an odd change of direction. To be honest, I hit rough patches from time to time; I am not perfect. However, after each end every hiccup I would learn from my mistakes, and through this, I built up some great study skills. I coasted up to the final test, then did a few assignments early in order to clear time for studying. The test itself was really just a regular final, but as a middle school student I had little experience with that. Despite that, I still did fine. I ended the class with a 94.5%, but in the long run it was the skills from that class that actually helped.</p>
    <p class="tab">After all is said and done, I have not faced a harder challenge since Algebra 1. Personally, that fact is almost annoying because of what I have come to achieve after the course. I have taken a biology course on top of my entire 8th-grade course load, and I did not write this essay about it. This ties back to the reason I am applying to IMSA: I want to be challenged again.</p>
